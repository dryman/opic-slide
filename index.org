* What is OPIC?
- Vision: redefine big data industry
- Strategy:
  - Scalable, off-memory data structures
  - Complexity of O(log(N)) to compete with O(Nlog(N)) platforms
- Applications: databases, search engines, all super scale data services (ex: google map)

* Background

** Data structures
- Reduces complexities of some predefined queries or operations
  - index -> data (array)
  - key -> value (map)
  - key -> existance of key (set)
  - enqueue, dequeue
- Usually implemented in memory

** Big data
- Almost all algorithms are based on sorting
  - Nlog(N) total CPU time (technically ~N/mlog(N/m), m is number of machines)
  - Includes hadoop, spark
- Sorting is not the most effcient algorithm for ALL queries
  - Look up data
  - Join
- Computing time: minutes to days

** Off-memory data structures
- Database indexes
  - btree
  - hash table
  - primary key, foreign key
- Search engine indexes
  - suffix tree, suffix array
- Usually computes in sub-seconds
- Every data structure is application specific

* Enter OPIC
- Write data structures in object oriented model
  - RB tree
  - BTree
  - Hash table
  - Graph
- All data structures can be serialized to disk or network
- Ideal case: dump a big chunk of memory to disk and restore it back

* Challenges
- In memory data structures are presented by pointers
- How do we manage pointers off-memory?

* Pointer categories
Imagine we have a managed memory that we can serialize.
There are three types of pointers that we need to handle:
- Internal references in managed memory
- In-bound: points into the managed memory
- Out-bound: points to external addresses

** Internal ref & in-bound
- Turns out internal reference and in-bound pointers are similar
- serialize:
  - pointer -> reference (valid off memory representation, discuss later)
- deserialize:
  - reference -> pointer

** Out-bound
- Depends on what the pointer points to
- Example:
  - pointing to in-memory object (X)
  - function pointer (Hard)
  - pointing to another managed memory
  - pointing to class type (will discuss later)
- Generally hard, avoid as much as possible

* Internal reference and in-bound pointers

** Concept
- Objects with same type are stored in one (logical) array
- Reference := type id + offset in array
- Typed logical arrays are managed by a memory manager
- Each memory manager can bulk serialize to disk and restore back
- A program might maintain multiple memory manager

** Memory manager (1)
- typed logical array
  - type info: type name, size, etc.
  - type slots
    - Each slot is sizeof(object) * N
    - When slot is full, create new slot of 2N
    - free memory := put object address into a priority queue
    - alloc :=
      1. find address in priority queue
      2. if not found, find new space in slot

** Memory manager (2)
- types are stored in type-map
- also maintain a map of pointer -> type slot
  - so that we can transfer a pointer to reference

* Out-bound pointers
- Can we eliminate all out-bound pointers?
- No. We need it to represent the type of an object

** Object type implementaions in different languages
- C++: vtable. number of pointers to vtable is implementation defined
- Rust: trait pointers. Hard to gather
- OCaml: JIT & compiled runtime has different form of vtable (?). Garbage collected memory is also hard to serialize.

* Build our own OO in C

** Why?
- Build our own vtable runtime is easier than hacking other language's runtime
- Learn from other language, make it better

* OO system design
- Generic type system (e.g. ~Map<String, Long>~)
- Runtime compose instead of static compose (C++ template is static compose)
  - Smaller binary and memory footprint

** Generic type

- Example in java:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
class Map<WritableComparable> {
  write(WritableComparable data, DataOutput out) {
    data.write(out); // write is defined in WritableComparable interface
  }
}
#+END_SRC

- Container object can call methods defined in generic interface
- Container do not need to know the implementation detail of ~data.write()~

** Runtime compose vs Static compose
- C++ is statically compose (template)
  - Template only lives in header
  - Duplicates binary for each composed types
  - Hard to create shared libraries for containers
- Hence we choose runtime composed objects
  - more runtime danger
  - May be solved by creating a new language like vala

* OPIC OO system

** Interface based OO system
- Define interfaces
- Define a class that implements one or more interfaces
- Each class has an global class object
  - global class object direct the interface methods to real implementation
- Object of same type has a ISA pointer points to the same class object

** TODO use ArrayList as an example
#+BEGIN_SRC dot

#+END_SRC

** generic function
- Implement ~OPObject* li_get(OPObject* list, uint64_t index)~
- list is a generic list, could be array list, linked list, etc.

1. Get ~list->ISA~, unique pointer for each class
2. Use ~list->ISA~ as a cache key to lookup function pointer
3. If the function pointer is found, execute ~fp(list, uint64_t index)~
4. If cache miss,
  - traverse through ISA traits and find the function pointer,
  - store ISA and function pointer to cache (C11 atomic store)
  - execute the function pointer

* Integrate OPIC OO system with serialization
** Serializing:
- Each object has one out-bound pointer (ISA)
- Serializing steps
  - write type header of the typed array
    - type name
    - total size of the typed array
  - Merge multiple slot to one array
  - Convert internal pointers to references
  - Write the array to disk
** deserializing
- Read the type info from type header
- Find the type ISA in global type map
- From the type ISA we know the size of the object
- For each object
  - Fill the ISA pointer
  - convert references to pointers

* Final notes

** trade-offs in design (1)
- No inheritance, even though it could be implemented
  - Enforce static type checking (no impl for interface => complie fail)
- Use gcc extensions extensively
  - ~__attribute__((constructor))~: register class object to global map before main
  - ~__attribute__(aligned(256))~: align address so we can store some extra flags in the pointers
  - SIMD vector types: Way easier to use than assemblies
  - All the features above is supported by gcc & clang
** trade-offs in design (2)
- Only support 64bit machines, may limit to =x86_64=
  - pointer size varies on different architectures
  - too much work to support different size of pointers
    - object size changes
    - reference may look different
    - 64bit->32bit may cause overflow
  - Big data processing machines are all =x86_64=

* Future challenges and road map
- concurrent memory manager (C11 atomic)
- cross memory manager reference
- LRU cache for memory managers
- compressed memory manager
- primitive types compression (may prioritize)
- distributed computing design (may use consistent hasing intensively)
- distributed data store design

* Road map2 (nice to have)
- Implement a mysql storage engine based on OPIC
- Distributed OLAP prototype.
- Software transactional memory + durability on data structures
  - WAL for limited set of data structure operations is possible
- Prototype NoSQL DB like LevelDB/RocksDB
- Durable program state?
  - Browser JS state serialized and off-load to memory or compressed
  - Smaller memory footprint for browsers

* Thank you
